# This is the configuration file for bochs
# bochs is an operating system simulator that lets you define the 
# hardware specifications to run your operating system ON

# telling bochs to load the boot sector in a floppy disk
# this is like having a floppy disk inserted into a make-believe machine
# and when the BIOS checks for boot devices, it will see a floppy disk with
# a proper boot sector
